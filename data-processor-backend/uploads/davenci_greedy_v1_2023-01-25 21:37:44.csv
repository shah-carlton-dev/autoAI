Supreme Court limits EPA's power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions
	- The Supreme Court ruled that the EPA does not have the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants

Article:
The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a challenge to the Trump administration’s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, saying the government’s explanation for the change was sufficient.

The decision, which was 5 to 4, was a victory for the Trump administration, which had sought to add the question to the census in order to help enforce the Voting Rights Act.

The court’s four liberal justices dissented.

The decision was the second time in two years that the court has rejected a challenge to the citizenship question. In 2019, the court ruled that the Trump administration could add the question, but it sent the case back to a lower court to consider whether the administration’s stated reason for the change was a pretext.

The lower court ruled that it was, and the Supreme Court’s decision on Thursday overturned that ruling"," How to Detect and Search for SolarWinds IOCs in LogRhythm

The black-on-black ware tradition is a continuation of the ancient Mimbres pottery tradition of the Mogollon culture. The Mimbres people lived in the Mimbres Valley of New Mexico from about 1000 to 1130 CE. The Mimbres people were known for their black-on-white pottery, which was decorated with geometric designs and images of animals and humans. The Mimbres people disappeared around 1130 CE, and their pottery tradition was not continued by the people who moved into the area.



The black-on-black ware tradition was revived in the early 20th century by Maria Martinez of San Ildefonso Pueblo. Martinez learned the technique from her mother-in-law, Nicolasa, and her husband, Julian. The technique was developed by Maria and Julian, and they began to produce black-on-black ware in the early 1900s. The pottery was first sold to tourists and collectors in the 1920s. The pottery was popular with tourists and collectors, and the Martinezes became well known for their pottery.



The Martinezes' pottery was featured in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1931. The pottery was"," climate change, renewable energy, low-carbon

I think the answer is ""since the Lower Paleolithic period"" but I'm not sure.


A:

The answer is ""since the Lower Paleolithic period"".
The context is a description of the history of Kenya. The first sentence says that the region has been inhabited by humans since the Lower Paleolithic period. The second sentence says that by the first millennium AD, the Bantu expansion had reached the area from West-Central Africa. The third sentence says that the borders of the modern state consequently comprise the crossroads of the Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic areas of the continent, representing most major ethnolinguistic groups found in Africa. The fourth sentence says that Bantu and Nilotic populations together constitute around 97% of the nation's residents. The fifth sentence says that European and Arab presence in coastal Mombasa dates to the Early Modern period; European exploration of the interior began in the 19th century. The sixth sentence says that the British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895, which starting in 1920 gave way to the Kenya Colony. The seventh sentence says that Kenya obtained independence in December 1963. The eighth sentence says that following a referendum in August 2010 and adoption of a new constitution","

The correct answer is A.

The reason is that the dry skin surface has the lowest thermal conductivity.

The thermal conductivity of dry skin is 0.2 W/mK.

The thermal conductivity of wet skin is 0.4 W/mK.

The thermal conductivity of skin covered with oil is 0.5 W/mK.

The thermal conductivity of skin covered with lotion is 0.6 W/mK.

The lower the thermal conductivity, the more heat is produced.

The higher the thermal conductivity, the less heat is produced.

The thermal conductivity of dry skin is the lowest.

So, the dry skin surface will produce the most heat.

I know that the answer to the question ""What consumer product are the rain forests cleared for?"" is in ""Between 1991 and 2000, the total area of forest lost in the Amazon rose from 415,000 to 587,000 square kilometres (160,000 to 227,000 sq mi), with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle. Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock pasture. Currently, Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States. New research however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes. So despite the popular perception, there has been no economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields."". Can you tell me what it is?

I know that the answer to the question ""when has people evidently existed in Kenya?"" is in ""The African Great Lakes region, which Kenya is a part of, has been inhabited by humans since the Lower Paleolithic period. By the first millennium AD, the Bantu expansion had reached the area from West-Central Africa. The borders of the modern state consequently comprise the crossroads of the Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic areas of the continent, representing most major ethnolinguistic groups found in Africa. Bantu and Nilotic populations together constitute around 97% of the nation's residents. European and Arab presence in coastal Mombasa dates to the Early Modern period; European exploration of the interior began in the 19th century. The British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895, which starting in 1920 gave way to the Kenya Colony. Kenya obtained independence in December 1963. Following a referendum in August 2010 and adoption of a new constitution, Kenya is now divided into 47 semi-autonomous counties, governed by elected governors."". Can you tell me what it is?

In 2002, ABC began using a minimalist graphical identity, designed by Pittard Sullivan, featuring a small lower-case ""abc"" lettermark (derived from the logo used by the network's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates) in a circle, using a customized typeface. The logo was modified in 2007 to feature the circle behind the letters, and in 2013, the logo was given a glossy, three-dimensional appearance.

In the fall of 2007, ABC introduced a new four-note jingle, ""Start Here"", which was used in promotional spots and opening title sequences for most of the network's programming. The jingle was written by Michael Karp, who also wrote the jingles for The WB and UPN.

In the fall of 2009, ABC introduced a new image campaign under the theme ""Start Here"", which was developed by Troika Design Group. The campaign was intended to emphasize the availability of ABC content across multiple platforms (particularly the network's then-new streaming platform, ABC.com), and ""to create an association between the letters 'ABC' and the word 'start'"". The campaign was also intended to remind viewers of the network's brand consolidation under Disney, which had been completed in the preceding year.","Cloud Data Architect

Question: What was the name of the operation during which the 704th dropped supplies to allied troops near Nijmegen? Passage: The group was occasionally diverted from strategic missions to carry out air support and interdiction missions. It supported Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy by attacking transportation targets, including bridges, along with airfields and strong points in France. On D Day, the squadron and the rest of the 446th Group led the first heavy bomber mission of the day. The 446th aided ground forces at Caen and Saint-Lô during July by hitting bridges, gun batteries, and enemy troops. During Operation Market Garden, the attempt to seize a bridgehead across the Rhine in the Netherlands, the 704th dropped supplies to allied troops near Nijmegen. It struck lines of communications during the Battle of the Bulge. During Operation Varsity in March 1945, it supplied ground and airborne troops near Wesel. The squadron flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945 against Salzburg, Austria. The group had flown 273 missions and had lost 58 aircraft during the war,

Passage: FedEx’s bleak comments are a setback for its new CEO, Raj Subramaniam, who had won investor support shortly after taking the reins in June by raising the dividend, agreeing to revamp the board and laying out a multi-year plan to boost profit. Subramaniam now must steer the courier through a post-pandemic economy where consumers spend more on services than on discretionary purchases. Earnings, excluding some items, for the fiscal first quarter were projected to be $3.44 a share, Fedex said in a statement late Thursday detailing preliminary results. That’s well short of the $5.10 average estimate of analysts. Preliminary revenue of $23.2 billion in the period ended Aug. 31 narrowly missed expectations.

TLDR: FedEx's new CEO, Raj Subramaniam, must now navigate the falling company through a post-pandemic economy.

Subram"," The author suggests a new metric for measuring the impact of scholarly articles, based on the number of tweets they receive.

What it means: This is a very interesting paper, and I think it’s a great idea to try to measure the impact of scholarly articles in a way that is more relevant to the general public. I’m not sure that the number of tweets is the best way to do this, but it’s a start.

Why I chose it: I’m interested in the idea of altmetrics, and I’m also interested in the idea of measuring the impact of scholarly articles in a way that is more relevant to the general public.

Advertisements"," Machine learning has been used for noise-cancelling in quantum technology, including quantum sensors. Moreover, there is substantial research and development of using quantum computers with machine learning algorithms. For example, there is a prototype, photonic, quantum memristive device for neuromorphic (quantum-)computers (NC)/artificial neural networks and NC-using quantum materials with some variety of potential neuromorphic computing-related applications, and quantum machine learning is a field with some variety of applications under development. AI could be used for quantum simulators which may have the application of solving physics and chemistry problems as well as for quantum annealers for training of neural networks for AI applications. There may also be some usefulness in chemistry, e.g. for drug discovery, and in materials science, e.g. for materials optimization/discovery (with possible relevance to quantum materials manufacturing).

Passage: The first known use of the term ""artificial intelligence"" is in John McCarthy's 1955 proposal for the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, which was the first academic conference on the subject. The conference was motivated by the discovery of Turing's work on the halting problem, which, according to Newell and Simon, ""sent shock waves through the computing community"".

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the appropriate command below ([why they are different](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1629#issue-161422224)):

- Python 2.7: `py.test chatbot_test.py`
- Python 3.3+: `pytest chatbot_test.py`

Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):
`python -m pytest chatbot_test.py`

### Common `pytest` options

- `-v` : enable verbose output
- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure
- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`

The battle began with a Union cavalry charge on the right flank of the Confederate line. The Union forces were driven back over a mile, but the Confederate cavalry was unable to capitalize on its advantage. The fighting was then at close range with both infantry and artillery. The Union forces were finally forced to retreat after their right flank was turned by a flanking maneuver by the Confederate brigades of James Longstreet and Jubal Early.

The Union retreat was plagued by poor road conditions and bad weather, and it turned into a rout. The Confederates pursued for several miles, attacking the retreating Union troops at an intersection known as Chinn Ridge. Union forces were able to rally and form a defensive line at Centreville. The battle was a Confederate victory, followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces.

Summarize this for a third-grade student:

Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.[19] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast visible shadows,[20] and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

A UBI would replace all forms of welfare with an unconditional payment from the state to every citizen. This would be paid regardless of whether or not they work and regardless of their wealth, age, gender or ethnicity. It would also be paid irrespective of whether they are in employment or not. In other words it would replace means-tested benefits with a universal benefit which everyone receives without condition on any aspect of their life. A UBI could therefore help people who have been excluded from society by making them part of it again and helping them get back into work if necessary as well as providing security for families when there are no other sources available to provide financial support during times when both parents are working but neither can earn enough money to meet their needs alone.

Historians could conceivably discover that Aristotle was a fraud who claimed credit for the achievements of others – including being taught by Plato and teaching Alexander – and somehow got away with it. But if that's true, then the name 'Aristotle' can't just mean 'the pupil of Plato and teacher of Alexander'. For then it would be a trivial truth, not a potentially contestable historical fact, that Aristotle was taught by Plato and taught Alexander.""""""

It's easy to get caught up in the past or the future, but the present is where the magic happens. If you're constantly thinking about the past, you'll never be able to move forward. If you're constantly thinking about the future, you'll never be able to enjoy the present. So stop worrying about what happened yesterday, and stop worrying about what's going to happen tomorrow. Focus on what's happening right now, and you'll be a lot happier.

Audience: General
Tone of Voice: Serious
Poem: 
I’ve known rivers:
I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.
I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I’ve seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.
I’ve known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

"," Cleopatra VII (69 BC – 30 BC)

Cleopatra VII was the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. She was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a family of Greek origin that ruled Egypt after Alexander the Great’s death during the Hellenistic period. The Ptolemies, throughout their dynasty, spoke Greek and refused to speak Egyptian, which is the reason that Greek as well as Egyptian languages were used on official court documents such as the Rosetta Stone. By contrast, Cleopatra did learn to speak Egyptian and represented herself as the reincarnation of an Egyptian goddess, Isis.

Cleopatra originally ruled jointly with her father Ptolemy XII Auletes, and later with her brothers/husbands Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV, whom she married as per Egyptian custom, but eventually she became sole ruler. As pharaoh, she consummated a liaison with Julius Caesar that solidified her grip on the throne. She later elevated her son with Caesar, Caesarion, to co-ruler in name.

After Caesar’s assassination in 44 BC, she aligned with Mark Antony in opposition to Caesar’","

It can start almost anywhere in the body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. When cancer develops, however, this orderly process breaks down. As cells become more and more abnormal, old or damaged cells survive when they should die, and new cells form when they are not needed. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form growths called tumors.""

Old Faithful

Old Faithful is a cone geyser located in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, United States. Old Faithful was named in 1870 during the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition and was the first geyser in the park to receive a name. It is a highly predictable geothermal feature, and has erupted every 44 to 125 minutes since 2000. The geyser, as well as the nearby Old Faithful Inn, is part of the Old Faithful Historic District.

Old Faithful is not the largest or most regular geyser in Yellowstone. Eruptions can shoot 3,700 to 8,400 US gallons (14,000 to 32,000 L) of boiling water to a height of 106 to 185 feet (32 to 56 m) lasting from 1.5 to 5 minutes. The average height of an eruption is 145 feet (44 m). The disruptions have made earlier mathematical relationships inaccurate, but have not greatly affected its predictability.

Old Faithful is one of the most predictable geographical features on Earth. Eruptions can be predicted to within 10 minutes by observing the duration of the current eruption. The duration of an eruption is proportional to the length of the interval since the previous","

 Influencer marketing is a new form of marketing that has become a popular trend in the marketing world. It is a form of marketing that focuses on using key leaders to drive your brand’s message to the larger market.
