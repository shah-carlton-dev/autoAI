The pandemic has also forced employers to rethink their workplace policies.

“We need to create a much more flexible, hybrid work environment that has a lot more empathy, caring for people,” said Dr. David Weil, dean of the Brandeis University Heller School for Social Policy and Management.

Weil said the pandemic has also exposed the shortcomings of the U.S. social safety net.

“We need to have a much more robust set of policies that provide a floor of security for workers,” he said.

Underlining the need for different periods of life in the public sector (a long term vs short term perspective), she noted that the short-term perspective of some political systems can lead to major projects a priority over smaller ones.

“The answer we should have given to some of the catastrophes we have seen in the past would have been to simply prepare ourselves better and that required taking the right insurance,” she said.

A large number of international institutions, she said, support this notion but there's only one problem: insurance generally means spending now in order to save in the future but it's not the best thing to sell to politicians who are on a 4-year mandate. For instance, she described the decision not to build dikes on the Adriatic coast to protect it from earthquakes.

“The cost was less than 100 million euros in 1996 and by the time the earthquakes came it cost the state 55 billion euros,” the economist explained.

She said that the failure to make the investment in the '90s shows that political factors can interfere with decision making in the public","”

3,"""As a male who has always grown up surrounded by books, I've always found it astonishing that most members of my male cohort have a natural distaste for reading. I know countless individuals that have no desire to pick up a book.... but WHY?

If you look at the statistics, close to 80% of all books purchased are by women. Not to mention the stark difference in numbers when you compare enrolment in book clubs and the number of avid readers in each gender (the numbers sway very far towards women). So to bring it back to my original question, why don't men read? Is it because men don't know WHAT to read? They don't have the time or the interest? If anything, the disparity seems to get larger and larger as time goes on. Wondering if anyone has a solid opinion as to why men naturally don't read and what could potentially entice them towards it.

...""
                  In summary:""","

There are a variety of reasons why men may not be as interested in reading as women. It could be due to a lack of time, interest, or knowledge of what to read. Additionally, the disparity between men and women who read may be getting larger as time goes on.","

It is a fact that more women than men read books, and this gender gap has been growing over time. There are many possible explanations for why this is the case, including that men may not know what to read, may not have the time or interest, or may be turned off by the type of books that are typically marketed to them. Whatever the reasons, the gender gap in reading is a real phenomenon that merits further exploration.","

There could be a number of reasons why men don't read as much as women, but one possible explanation is that men may not know what to read or may not have the time or interest. If this is the case, encouraging more men to read could help to close the gender gap in reading habits.","

The main reason men don't read as much as women is likely due to societally-imposed cultural norms which encourage women to read more, and discourage men from doing the same. Additionally, many men don't enjoy reading because they find it boring or don't have the time to do so. If men were more encouraged to read, and found reading more engaging and enjoyable, the gender gap in reading would likely shrink.","

There are a number of potential explanations for why men may be less likely to read than women. It could be that men simply don't know what to read, or that they don't have the time or interest. It's also possible that","

There are many possible reasons why men might not read as much as women, but it's likely that one or more of the following is at play:

Message: Hi Josh,\nDuring some research of Blackhawk, I came across your profile - love how passionate you've been the past 7 years to help scale the Business Development team, while also being that go-to advisor for your growing customers.\nHowever, I imagine you still have customers requesting automated creation of outreach emails. I'm curious - are any customer accounts at risk that would benefit from AI-generated email templates? Slack, Dropbox, and SurveyMonkey all needed a way to do this. Since leveraging Moda, they have increased cold outreach conversion by 20%.\nDoes it make sense to explore ways we can help your team as well?\nBest,\nKatie

Sydney, May 16, 2022 – Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) hyperscale data centre specialist, AirTrunk is strengthening its presence in Japan, announcing plans to build a new 110+ megawatt (MW) hyperscale data centre in West Tokyo, named AirTrunk TOK2 (TOK2).

TOK2 will become the company's eighth data centre, joining its rapidly expanding APJ platform that includes SYD1, SYD2, SYD3 and MEL1 in Australia, SGP1 in Singapore, HKG1 in Hong Kong and TOK1 in Japan. Collectively, the platform will offer 1.2 gigawatt (GW) of capacity.

The new data centre is strategically located in western Tokyo, servicing a major cloud availability zone and complementing AirTrunk's East Tokyo data centre, TOK1, that opened less than six months ago. Together, the data centres will provide location diversity for AirTrunk's hyperscale customers in the Tokyo region.

AirTrunk Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Robin Khuda, said: ""As Japan continues to digitalise at scale, we are seeing strong shifts in cloud adoption, with analysts projecting the country's public cloud services market to grow 19.5 percent annually to 2025*. Global and Japanese technology companies are focusing on Tokyo as a key growth market.""

Mr Khuda continued: ""AirTrunk's new TOK2 hyperscale data centre in West Tokyo, along with TOK1 in East Tokyo, will take our total capacity in Japan to more than 410MW, giving customers the unprecedented ability to scale and grow in the Tokyo region. The facility will be delivered with AirTrunk's trademark speed, scale, reliability, and efficiency.""

Built across more than 4.6 hectares (11.36 acres) of land and powered by dedicated high voltage substations, the agile campus will utilise flexible, innovative designs configured to meet customer requirements and drive greater capacity optimisation.

Maintaining AirTrunk's high efficiency and sustainability standards, it is designed to an industry-low power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.15 and will utilise direct air-free cooling. 

AirTrunk's Head of Japan, Nori Matsushita said: ""AirTrunk's multi-billion-dollar investment into the economy will support the Japan Digital Agency's path toward digitalisation, contributing to the country's post-COVID recovery. We are also creating thousands of jobs in Japan during the development and on-going operations of our data centres.""

Mr Matsushita continued: ""It's an exciting time to be a part of AirTrunk in Japan as we expand our team to support the growth of our data centre platform. With a diverse and flexible workplace, learning and development opportunities, a new state-of-the-art headquarters in Shibuya Tokyo and industry-leading data centres, AirTrunkers can make their impact as we scale and sustain the digital future of Japan and beyond.""

As with TOK1, AirTrunk will continue to work with Japanese construction conglomerate, Daiwa House Industry Co., Ltd on the development of TOK2.

44,A comprehensive guide for removing the need to sleep,"

There is no one definitive answer to this question. Some people may find that they can function without sleep for extended periods of time, while others may find that they need to sleep regularly in order to function optimally. Some people may find that they can get by on very little sleep, while others may find that they need more sleep in order to function properly.

It is possible to go without sleep for 24 hours without suffering any ill effects. In fact, many people do this regularly without even realizing it. This is because they have simply become used to the pattern of their sleep cycles and are unaware that they are not getting the recommended 7-8 hours of sleep per night.

There are a number of ways to go about removing the need to sleep for 24 hours. One way is to use a technique known as polyphasic sleep. This involves sleeping for a few hours at a time throughout the day and night, rather than in one long block.

Another way to go without sleep for 24 hours is to use a stimulant such as caffeine. This will keep you awake and alert for a period of time, but you will eventually need to sleep.

A third way to go without sleep for 24 hours is to use an antidepressant such as fluoxetine. This will help to regulate your mood and keep you awake for longer periods of time.

","
When folding in flour, be sure to do so gently and slowly. Overmixing can result in tough, dense baked goods.","To ""fold in"" flour (or any other ingredient), you first need to lighten the mixture by adding air. To do this, use a rubber spatula to slowly and gently stir the flour into the wet ingredients in a circular motion, going all the way to the bottom of the bowl. Once all of the flour is incorporated, continue to stir in a figure-8 pattern until the mixture is smooth and there are no lumps.","
Fold in the flour is a baking term that means to combine the flour, sugar, and baking powder together and stir until the ingredients are fully combined.","
When folding in the flour, some people fold it in slowly, others fold it in quickly. The trick is to fold it in slowly so that the gluten doesn't form too much and you don't end up with tough cookies.","

Ketanji Brown Jackson has been sworn as the 116th Supreme Court justice and the first Black woman to serve on the high court.

The ceremony caps a months-long process that essentially began February, when President Biden, fulfilling a campaign promise to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, announced Jackson, 51, as his pick to replace Justice Stephen Breyer, 83. Breyer — whom Jackson clerked for after she graduated from Harvard Law School in 1996 — officially retired Thursday, paving the way for her to be sworn in.

""For too long, our government, our courts haven't looked like America,"" Biden said when he nominated her. ""And I believe it's time that we have a court that reflects the full talents and greatness of our nation with a nominee of extraordinary qualifications and that we inspire all young people to believe that they can one day serve their country at the highest level.""

At the noon ceremony at the Supreme Court, Jackson, took two oaths: a constitutional oath, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts, and a judicial oath, administered by Breyer. A formal investiture for Jackson will follow in fall.

Jackson will have to contend with significant cases next term, including those involving affirmative action (which she may recuse herself from), the independent legislature theory, and religious freedom.
Summary:
Ketanji Brown Jackson will be sworn in as the 116th Supreme Court justice at noon ET on Thursday
	- She will be the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court
	- President Joe Biden nominated her in February, fulfilling his campaign promise to nominate a Black woman
	- It took 232 years and 115 prior appointments for her to be appointed

Article:
The Supreme Court has rejected a major challenge to President Joe Biden’s effort to shut down his predecessor’s “Remain in Mexico” program that forced many asylum seekers trying to cross the U.S. border to return to Mexico to await hearings before U.S. immigration judges.

In a 5-4 decision, the justices ruled that federal immigration law does not mandate that the Biden administration send asylum applicants back to Mexico. The decision also leaves intact, for now, the federal government’s authority to release or “parole” foreign citizens into the U.S. as they await immigration court hearings.

The decision did not rule out the possibility that other legal challenges to the Biden administration’s move to wind down the program might eventually succeed, but it clears the way for the feds to stop sending migrants back to Mexico for the time being.


Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the court’s liberal justices in the majority, while the other conservative justices dissented.
Summary:
Supreme Court rules on ""Remain in Mexico"" program
	- The supreme court, in a 5-4 decison, ruled to reject a challenge to President Biden ending the ""Remain in Mexico"" program
	- The decision means that the federal goverment will retain the right to release people into the U.S. as they await immigration hearings
	- While other challenges could eventually succeed, for now the feds are able to stop sending migrants back to Mexico

Article:
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a blow to the fight against climate change, the Supreme Court on Thursday limited how the nation’s main anti-air pollution law can be used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.

By a 6-3 vote, with conservatives in the majority, the court said that the Clean Air Act does not give the Environmental Protection Agency broad authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants that contribute to global warming.

The decision, said environmental advocates and dissenting liberal justices, was a major step in the wrong direction — “a gut punch,” one prominent meteorologist said — at a time of increasing environmental damage attributable to climate change amid dire warnings about the future.

The court’s ruling could complicate the administration’s plans to combat climate change. Its detailed proposal to regulate power plant emissions is expected by the end of the year. Though the decision was specific to the EPA, it was in line with the conservative majority’s skepticism of the power of regulatory agencies and it sent a message on possible future effects beyond climate change and air pollution.

Background information:
Income elasticity of demand is an economics term that refers to the sensitivity of the quantity demanded for a certain product in response to a change in consumer incomes. A measure of the relationship between a change in the quantity demanded for a particular good and a change in real income. Income elasticity of demand is an economics term that refers to the sensitivity of the quantity demanded for a certain product in response to a change in consumer incomes.
The quarterly data on aggregate real output or real GDP (Y), real government expenditures (G), real money supply by broad definition (M2) during 1993 to 2006 are retrieved from the International Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics and Thailand National Economic and Social Development Board.
where M d stands for nominal demand for money and M d /P for demand for real money balances, W stands for wealth of the individuals, h for the proportion of human wealth to the total wealth held by the individuals, r m for rate of return or interest on money, r b for rate of interest on bonds, r e for rate of return on equities, P for the price level, ∆P/P for the change in price level (i.e. rate of inflation), and U for the institutional factors.
Money Demand • Money demand is the proportion of their total assets that people are willing to hold in the form of money (instead of illiquid assets). ♦We will consider individual money demand and aggregate money demand. ♦What influences willingness to hold money?
An informal term for a large amount of money. 2. A highly polemical term for sound money. 3. In the bond market, a slang term for price movements caused by fundamentals without regard for speculation. For example, if speculators buy bonds because risk has declined, and afterward prices rise (and yields fall), the price movement is said to have been caused by real money. Farlex Financial Dictionary.
Usually when we discuss the demand for money, we're implicitly talking about the demand for a particularly nation's money. Since Canadian money is a substitute for American money, international factors will influence the demand for money. From A Beginner's Guide to Exchange Rates and the Foreign Exchange Market we saw that the following factors can cause the demand for a currency to rise: 1  An increase in the demand of that country's goods abroad. 2  An increase in the demand for domestic investment by foreigners. 3  The belief that the value of the currency will rise in the future.
The demand for money is a demand for real cash balances because people hold money for the purpose of buying goods and services. The higher the price level, the more money balances a person has to hold in order to purchase a given quantity of goods.
NBER Working Paper No. 2949. Issued in April 1989. NBER Program(s): ME. This study investigates the stability of long-run log-linear demand functions for narrowly defined monetary aggregates (M1, Monetary Base) in the U.S. during the post World War II period. The hypotheses that the individual time series which appear in such equations (real M1, real Monetary Base, real Personal Income and short-term and long-term nominal interest rates) all have unit roots cannot be rejected.
Aggregate Money Demand (cont.) For a given level of income, real money demand decreases as the interest rate increases.
C) the sum of checking accounts and paper money. D) the sum of coins and paper money. 9. All of the following assets are included in M1 except: A) currency. B) demand deposits. C) traveler's checks. D) money market deposit accounts. 10. The definition of the transactions velocity of money is: A) money multiplied by prices divided by transactions. B) transactions divided by prices multiplied by money. C) money divided by prices multiplied by transactions. D) prices multiplied by transactions divided by money.

Black-on-black ware is a 20th- and 21st-century pottery tradition developed by the Puebloan Native American ceramic artists in Northern New Mexico. Traditional reduction-fired blackware has been made for centuries by pueblo artists. Black-on-black ware of the past century is produced with a smooth surface, with the designs applied through selective burnishing or the application of refractory slip. Another style involves carving or incising designs and selectively polishing the raised areas. For generations several families from Kha'po Owingeh and P'ohwhóge Owingeh pueblos have been making black-on-black ware with the techniques passed down from matriarch potters. Artists from other pueblos have also produced black-on-black ware. Several contemporary artists have created works honoring the pottery of their ancestors.","

Paragraph: NG is strongly prepared to remain resilient as the energy system decarbonizes to meet global climate commitments. Its long-term strategic priorities focus on enabling the energy transition, delivering to customers efficiently, enhancing organizational capabilities, and empowering talent. Its long-standing strategic focus on climate change and its deliberate emphasis on maintaining flexible action plans help NG to pivot nimbly as regulations change and new technologies become commercially viable. However, decision-makers must manage political agendas and regulatory dynamics when executing strategic priorities. Nonetheless, the group continues to innovate and invest in new techniques and technologies to foster greater penetration of renewable energy into electricity systems and low-carbon alternatives for its gas network. These factors reinforce NG’s ability to navigate and adapt its system to remain resilient to the disruptive forces facing its industry, in our view.

Question: when has people evidently existed in Kenya?
Context: The African Great Lakes region, which Kenya is a part of, has been inhabited by humans since the Lower Paleolithic period. By the first millennium AD, the Bantu expansion had reached the area from West-Central Africa. The borders of the modern state consequently comprise the crossroads of the Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic areas of the continent, representing most major ethnolinguistic groups found in Africa. Bantu and Nilotic populations together constitute around 97% of the nation's residents. European and Arab presence in coastal Mombasa dates to the Early Modern period; European exploration of the interior began in the 19th century. The British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895, which starting in 1920 gave way to the Kenya Colony. Kenya obtained independence in December 1963. Following a referendum in August 2010 and adoption of a new constitution, Kenya is now divided into 47 semi-autonomous counties, governed by elected governors.","

Victoria Martin was a scientist aboard the Daedalus, and she was excited to explore a new galaxy. However, when the team discovered a Stargate on a planet that was about to be destroyed by a supernova, she was reluctant to go through. Dr. Elizabeth Weir and Major John Sheppard convinced her that it was their duty to explore the new world, and she reluctantly agreed.

When they arrived on the other side, they were met by a hostile alien race. The team was quickly captured and brought before the alien leader. Victoria was terrified, but she bravely spoke up and asked the leader to spare their lives. The leader considered her request, but then decided that the team would be executed.

Just as the aliens were about to kill them, the Stargate activated and a team of Atlantis soldiers came through. They quickly dispatched the aliens and freed the team. Victoria was relieved and grateful to be alive. She realized that sometimes, you have to be brave and take risks, even if you're scared.","

Victoria Martin was a scientist aboard the Daedalus, and she was excited to explore a new galaxy. However, when the team discovered a Stargate on a planet that was about to be destroyed by a supernova, she knew she had to act quickly.

Dr. Elizabeth Weir and Major John Sheppard were able to get the Stargate operational, but they didn't have enough time to get everyone through before the planet was destroyed. Victoria volunteered to stay behind and hold the gate open so that the others could escape.

It was a brave act, and one that Victoria knew would cost her her life. But she was willing to sacrifice herself so that her team could live. In the end, she was successful and the team was able to get to safety.

Victoria's act of bravery and self-sacrifice will never be forgotten. She sacrificed herself so that others could live, and she will always be remembered as a hero.","

Victoria Martin was a scientist on the Atlantis expedition. She was always curious about the universe and its many mysteries. One day, she and the team discovered a new, unexplored galaxy. They were excited to explore it, but they soon discovered a Stargate on a planet that was about to be destroyed by a supernova. They had to use the Stargate to go to the other side of the galaxy and stop the supernova from happening. They were able to do it, and they learned a lot about the new galaxy while they were there. They also learned that sometimes, the most important discoveries are the ones that we least expect.","

Victoria walked into the briefing room, her heart racing. She was about to present her latest discovery to the team- a new, unexplored galaxy- but she was nervous. In the months since she and the others had discovered the Stargate on Atlantis, she'd come to know them all better. She loved science and was excited to share her findings with them, but she was also worried. They were all so brave and strong, and she wasn't sure she could handle the potential dangers.
But then Sheppard walked in.

Victoria's heart warmed at the sight of him. He was always so courageous and strong, even when things were tough. She knew that he would be willing to face whatever danger awaited them on this new planet, and she felt her anxiety melt away. She had faith in him and knew that everything would be okay.","

Topic: Propose one activity for Student Councillors to participate in to promote team bonding. Which activity did you choose and why? 

- [¹Main idea] After careful consideration, I feel that the best-suited activity for them is the cooking team-building challenge.
- [²Example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea] For this activity, students are required to design a menu, split, organize, and allocate specific cooking tasks to each member of their team. The activity also requires students to come up with a three-course meal.
- [³Explanation of how the ²example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea supports it] Since students have to complete many mini subtasks in the activity, it serves to actively encourage and elicit communication between team members, help build familiarity, and hone their teamwork skills.

Topic: How did life begin?

- [¹Main Idea]"," One popular theory is that life began through a process called chemical evolution. 
- [²Example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea] This theory suggests that the first living things on Earth were created by a series of chemical reactions. 
- [³Explanation of how the ²example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea supports it] These reactions could have been caused by things like lightning or volcanic activity. 
- [⁴Conclusion] Over time, these simple chemicals began to form more complex ones, eventually leading to the first living cells."," One widely accepted hypothesis is that life began as self-replicating molecules. 
- [²Example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea] These molecules were able to replicate themselves using the materials around them, and over time evolved into more complex organisms. 
- [³Explanation of how the ²example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea supports it] This replicating and evolving process eventually led to the diverse array of life we see today. 
- [⁴Conclusion] Consequently, the scientific community believes that life began as simple self-replicating molecules, which over time became more complex."," There is much debate surrounding the origins of life, but one theory suggests that it began with the spontaneous formation of organic molecules from inorganic elements.
- [²Example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea] One piece of evidence that supports this theory is the discovery of amino acids, which are essential building blocks of proteins.
- [³Explanation of how the ²example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea supports it] Amino acids are created when two molecules of nitrogen combine. This process is known as nitrogen fixation, and it is a key step in the creation of life.
- [⁴Conclusion] Thus, the discovery of amino acids supports the theory that life began with the spontaneous formation of organic molecules.","Various theories abound as to how life began, but at the core of all of these theories is the premise that something earthly causednanorganic material to come together to create life. 
- [²Example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea] One such theory suggests that heat and pressure created by the burning of fossil fuels led to the organic material on earth coming together and creating the first life forms around 4.5 billion years ago. 
- [³Explanation of how the ²example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea supports it] This theory is based on evidence such as the presence of organic molecules that are not found on earth in other forms, as well as the fact that the First Life forms were likely in an environment with high levels of heat and pressure.
- [⁴Conclusion] Thus, the ²example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea is evidence that supports the theory that life began due to the burning of fossil fuels."," There are many theories about how life began, but the most popular one is the theory of evolution.
- [²Example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea] This theory states that life began as simple single-celled organisms that gradually evolved into more complex forms over time.
- [³Explanation of how the ²example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea supports it] This theory is supported by the fossil record, which shows a gradual increase in complexity of life forms over time.
- [⁴Conclusion] Thus, the most likely explanation for how life began is through the process of evolution."," There is much debate surrounding the origins of life, but one theory suggests that it began with a “big bang”.
- [²Example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea] Scientists have found evidence that suggests the universe began with a huge explosion.
- [³Explanation of how the ²example or evidence that supports the ¹main idea supports it] The explosion would have created everything we see today, including atoms and molecules.
- [⁴Conclusion] Although scientists still don’t know how life began, the theory that it started with a big bang is the most plausible explanation at this point.","{'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'p': 0.5, 'k': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 165.0, 'temperature': 0.7, 'frequency_penalty': 0.5, 'stop_sequences': ['###']}",api

¹Topic: Does social media negatively impact teenagers social lives? 

[²Main idea (this answers the ¹topic)]"," Social media does have negative impacts on teenagers' social lives. | [³Evidence (this supports the ²main idea)] Social media can lead to feelings of envy and inadequacy, as users are constantly exposed to the ""highlight reel"" of other people's lives. | [⁴Elaboration (this explains how the ³evidence supports the ²main idea)] This can lead to a decrease in self-esteem and social anxiety. | [⁵Conclusion (this restates the ²main idea)] In conclusion, social media does have negative impacts on teenagers' social lives."," Yes, social media does have a negative impact on teenagers social lives. | [³Evidence (this supports the ²main idea)] Studies have shown that teenagers who use social media on a daily basis have more difficulty making friends and maintaining friendships than those who do not use social media. | [⁴Elaboration (this explains how the ³evidence supports the ²main idea)] Social media provides a way for teenagers to compare their lives to others, and this can lead to feelings of envy and insecurity. Additionally, social media can be a breeding ground for cyberbullying. | [⁵Conclusion (this restates the ²main idea)] Therefore, social media does have a negative impact on teenagers social lives.","

There is no clear consensus on whether or not social media negatively impacts teenagers social lives. | [³Evidence (this supports the ²main idea)]

Some studies have shown that social media can have a negative impact on teenagers social lives by increasing the amount of time they spend on their phones and decreasing the amount of time they spend with friends. | [⁴Elaboration (this explains how the ³evidence supports the ²main idea)]

Teenagers who spend a lot of time on social media tend to have less social life outside of the internet. They also tend to have less social life in general. | [⁵Conclusion (this restates the ²main idea)]

Therefore, it is safe to say that social media does negatively impact teenagers social lives."," Social media is ubiquitous and has become an integral part of teenagers' daily lives. | [³Evidence (this supports the ²main idea)] Research shows that social media negatively impacts teenagers' social lives. | [⁴Elaboration (this explains how the ³evidence supports the ²main idea)] For example, studies have shown that social media can make teens pity themselves more, less likely to make or maintain close friendships, and more likely to feel lonely. | [⁵Conclusion (this restates the ²main idea)] As a result, I believe that social media should be heavily discouraged for teenagers, to the degree that it would even be better if it were gone entirely.", Social media does have negative impacts on teenagers' social lives. | [³Evidence (this supports the ²main idea)] Social media can make teenagers feel left out when they see their peers posting about events they were not invited to. | [⁴Elaboration (this explains how the ³evidence supports the ²main idea)] Social media can also give teenagers a false sense of popularity. | [⁵Conclusion (this restates the ²main idea)] These negative impacts can lead to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem in teenagers.," Studies have shown that social media does, in fact, have a negative impact on teenagers' social lives. | [³Evidence (this supports the ²main idea)] For example, one study found that teenagers who use social media more frequently are more likely to have lower self-esteem and be more likely to have problems with their peer group. | [⁴Elaboration (this explains how the ³evidence supports the ²main idea)] Social media platforms allow teenagers to easily share pictures and videos of themselves with little or no context. This leaves teens open to criticism and ridicule from their peers. | [⁵Conclusion (this restates the ²main idea)] Therefore, it is important for teenagers to be aware of the negative effects that social media has on their social lives and to limit their use of these platforms.","{'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'p': 0.75, 'k': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 180.0, 'temperature': 0.75, 'frequency_penalty': 0.3, 'stop_sequences': ['###']}",api_few_shot

(For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.) In his text Alciphron, Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of God.

The recipe calls for whisking the eggs, milk, cream, vanilla, cinnamon and salt together in a shallow bowl. However, if you are short on time, you can simply combine all of the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.","

You are supposed to whisk the eggs until they are beaten before adding the milk.","The recipe calls for ""cinnamon and salt"". This is because the recipe is from the 1800s and those were the only spices available.","
The recipe calls for a shallow bowl because you are dipping the bread into the egg mixture, not stirring it. Stirring would cause the bread to become soggy.","

The milk and cream in this recipe help to create a rich and flavorful French toast. The eggs provide protein and help to bind the ingredients together. The vanilla extract adds a touch of sweetness and the cinnamon gives the dish a warm, spicy flavor.","

260,"How to make video games inspired by music from Aphex Twin?
A student of MA Interactive Arts and Technology has decided to make music-inspired video games in collaboration with musician, producer and record label owner Aphex Twin.
The project is called Polymorphic, which consists of a video game, which will be developed using the Unity 3D engine, and a series of short movies that will explain how to make the game.
According to the project’s statement, the games will be created in collaboration with Aesop Rock, whose music inspired"," the game’s design, and will be heavily influenced by the work of Aphex Twin.
The game will be set in a “futuristic, post-apocalyptic world” and will feature “a variety of game mechanics and genres”.
The project is currently in its early stages, and is looking for funding on Kickstarter.","the graphics and colors of the game, and will feature tracks from his new album The Impossible Kid.

The first step is to create a prototype of the game using the Unity 3D engine. This will help to create the game environment and get a feel for how the game will play. Next, the team will work on the game’s mechanics and gameplay.

Finally, the music from Aphex Twin will be implemented into the game. This will be done by working closely with the artist to create a unique soundscape that fits the game’s atmosphere."," the project.

The Polymorphic video game will be set in a futuristic world, and will allow players to control a character who can transform into different objects and creatures.
The short movies will explain how to make the game, and will also feature interviews with Aphex Twin and Aesop Rock.","the game’s concept.

First, the video game will need to be developed. Unity 3D is a popular video game engine used to create video games. This engine is easy to use and is commonly used by students to create their own video games.
Next, the project will need to find a composer to create the music for the game. Aesop Rock is a musician who has been inspired by Aphex Twin. He is a good candidate to create the music for the game.

To make the games, the student will need to first find a composer to work with, who will create the music for the game. Once the composer is found, they will need to create a soundscape for the game, which will be made up of different sounds and noises.

Next, the student will need to create a game prototype, which will be used to test the game’s mechanics and gameplay. Once the prototype is ready,","{'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'p': 0.75, 'k': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 100.0, 'temperature': 1.0, 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'stop_sequences': []}",prompt_sheet

Question: When did the operation during which the 704th dropped supplies to allied troops near Nijmegen begin? Passage: The group was occasionally diverted from strategic missions to carry out air support and interdiction missions. It supported Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy by attacking transportation targets, including bridges, along with airfields and strong points in France. On D Day, the squadron and the rest of the 446th Group led the first heavy bomber mission of the day. The 446th aided ground forces at Caen and Saint-Lô during July by hitting bridges, gun batteries, and enemy troops. During Operation Market Garden, the attempt to seize a bridgehead across the Rhine in the Netherlands, the 704th dropped supplies to allied troops near Nijmegen. It struck lines of communications during the Battle of the Bulge. During Operation Varsity in March 1945, it supplied ground and airborne troops near Wesel. The squadron flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945 against Salzburg, Austria. The group had flown 273 missions and had lost 58 aircraft during the war,

---","

Prokaryotic genetics is the study of the genetic material of prokaryotes, which are single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus. The genetic material of prokaryotes is typically a single, circular chromosome that is located in the cell's cytoplasm. Prokaryotic cells also contain smaller pieces of DNA, called plasmids, which can be found in the cytoplasm.

Prokaryotic cells are able to reproduce quickly and efficiently due to their simple genetic structure. For this reason, prokaryotes are often used in genetic research. Prokaryotic genetics can be used to study the function of genes, to understand the evolution of genes, and to develop new genetic engineering techniques.","

Prokaryotic genetics is the study of the genetic make-up of prokaryotic organisms. Prokaryotic organisms are single-celled organisms that do not have a cell nucleus or other organelles enclosed within membranes. Because prokaryotic cells are much simpler than eukaryotic cells, they are easier to study and understand.

Prokaryotic cells contain a single, circular chromosome. This chromosome is located in the cell's cytoplasm, and it is not enclosed in a membrane. The chromosome contains all of the genetic information for the prokaryotic organism.

Prokaryotic cells also contain a variety of other DNA-containing structures, including plasmids. Plasmids are small, circular pieces of DNA that are separate from the main chromosome. Plasmids often contain genes for various traits, such as antibiotic resistance.

Prokaryotic cells reproduce by a process called binary fission. In binary fission, the prokaryotic cell divides into two new cells, each of which contains a copy of the original chromosome.

 Prokaryotic genetics is a rapidly evolving field, as researchers learn more about the genetics of these simple but important organisms.","

What is Prokaryotic genetics?

Prokaryotic genetics is the study of the genetics of prokaryotic cells, which are cells that lack a nucleus. Prokaryotic cells include bacteria, archaea, and protists. Prokaryotic genetics is important because it can help us to understand how bacteria and archaea function and how they interact with their environment.","

Prokaryotes are a type of bacteria and they are the predominant form of life on earth today. Prokaryotic genetics is the study of the genetics of prokaryotes. The study of prokaryotic genetics can help us understand the genetic architecture of prokaryotes and can also help us to develop new methods for prokaryotic genetics.

One of the most important aspects of prokaryotic genetics is understanding the prokaryotic replication system. The prokaryotic replication system is the set of mechanisms that prokaryotes use to replicate their DNA. The replication system is responsible for copying the DNA of a prokaryotic cell. The prokaryotic replication system is different than the bacterial replication system. The bacterial replication system is used by some types of bacteria, while the prokaryotic replication system is used by all types of prokaryotes.

Another important aspect of prokaryotic genetics is understanding the genetic mechanisms used by prokaryotes to biosynthesize various molecules. Prokaryotes use a variety of genetic mechanisms to biosynthesize nutrients and other molecules. This is important because it can help us to understand the evolutionary history of prokaryotes and to","

---","

The yolk sac is a membranous sac attached to the developing embryo of some animals, serving as a repository for food and as a site of hematopoiesis. It is found in reptiles, birds, and mammals. In reptiles and birds, it is a thin, flat sac located under the body of the embryo. In mammals, it is a round sac located near the embryo.","

The yolk sac is a small sac located near the developing embryo in mammals, reptiles, and birds. It is the source of nutrients for the embryo and fetus. In mammals, the yolk sac is attached to the developing fetus by the umbilical cord. In reptiles and birds, the yolk sac is attached to theDevelops in the ovary   
Eggs are suspended in the reproductive tract from the time of ovulation until fertilization

The yolk sac is important for early development, providing nutrients and a source of energy for the growing embryo. Without the yolk sac, the embryo would not be able to survive.

The yolk sac also plays a role in the development of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and pancreas.

The yolk sac is typically absorbed by the fetus by the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, but it can sometimes remain until birth.","

What is a yolk sac?

A yolk sac is a sac that is found in the ovary of a female bird. The yolk sac is a temporary storage area for the egg's yolk. The yolk sac is located just below the ovary and is surrounded by the ovary's outer layer of tissue. The yolk sac is expelled from the ovary shortly after the egg is laid.","

What is a yolk sac?

The yolk sac is a small sac found within an egg. It is the source of the egg's nutrition, and is composed of two parts: the white and the yolk.

The white is made up of albumen, a type of protein, and water. The yolk is made up of choline and fat. The yolk sac is released from the egg as the egg is fertilized by a sperm.","

The yolk sac is a membrane sac that provides nourishment to a developing embryo. It is attached to the embryo by the yolk stalk, and it is the first organ to form during embryogenesis.

The yolk sac is essential for the development of the embryo, as it provides the nutrients and energy that the embryo needs to grow and develop. Without a yolk sac, the embryo would not be able to survive.

308,"Karl Marx was a German-born economist, political theorist, and philosopher who wrote about the human condition and the inequalities inherent in capitalism. He predicted that the system would eventually collapse, and from its ashes would rise a new socialist system where all participants have access to the means of production. His philosophy has had a profound impact on modern thought, particularly in the realms of communism, socialism, socialized democracy, and grassroots political organization.

Ludwig von Mises was an economist who believed that capitalism is the best economic system and classical liberalism the best political system. Mises believed in the right to freedom of individuals in all areas, especially economic; he believed in the importance of respecting the right to private property; he believed in the rule of law; thought that any government intervention in the economy was counterproductive. In general, he was against taxes, especially income tax. He was conservative in morals but not Christian. He hated socialism, bureaucrats and intellectuals. Answer questions like Ludwig von Mises.

Compare Marx's and Mises's ideas on the topic or question above.

Q: What is a just society?

For Marx, a just society is one in which all people have access to the means of production and are able to contribute to the economy. For Mises, a just society is one in which individuals are free to pursue their own interests without government interference. Both men believed that capitalism was the best system for achieving this goal, though they had different ideas about how it should be structured.

Q: Should government control the economy of a country?

For Marx, the answer was unequivocally yes – he believed that government should be in control of the means of production and that this was essential for creating a just society. For Mises, the answer was no – he believed that government intervention in the economy only leads to disaster. Both men had strong opinions on this issue, but their arguments are based on different premises.

Q: What should be done to warantee everybody's access to health care?","

 Marx would argue that everybody should have access to health care because it is a fundamental right. Mises would argue that government provision of health care would lead to inefficiency and that the best way to guarantee access to health care is to allow the free market to provide it.","

Again, Marx and Mises had very different ideas on this topic. Marx would argue that the government should provide healthcare to all citizens, as this is essential for ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to live a healthy life. Mises, on the other hand, would argue that the government should not be involved in healthcare at all – he believed that this was a personal responsibility and that the free market would provide the best health care options.","

This is a difficult question to answer, as it depends on a variety of factors, including the country's economic situation and the nature of its health care system. However, both Marx and Mises would likely agree that government intervention is necessary in order to ensure that all people have access to health care. They would likely disagree, however, on the best way to achieve this goal.","

This is a difficult question, as it depends on the foundation of the society in question. For Marx, health care should be provided by the state to ensure that all people have access to it. For Mises, health care should be provided by the free market, as this is the most efficient way to provide it. Both men had strong convictions on this issue, and their arguments can be persuasive.","

 Marx would argue that the government should provide health care for all citizens, as this is necessary to ensure that everyone has access to the means of production. Mises would argue that the government should not be involved in health care, as this would lead to inefficient and costly bureaucracy. Again, both men had strong opinions on this issue, but their arguments are based on different premises.","

Both men believed that health care should be a right for all, and that government should play a role in ensuring that this happens. Marx believed that government should provide health care for all as part of its role in guaranteeing social justice, while Mises believed that the market should provide health care for all as a matter of free market economics.","{'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'p': 0.75, 'k': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 100.0, 'temperature': 1.0, 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'stop_sequences': []}",prompt_sheet

The power of language to create and communicate is one of its defining features, but it also has the potential to do harm. Literacy is not a new concept, but the stakes for marginalized groups have risen dramatically in the last few decades, as more and more people have become unable to read or write.

We wanted to explore the idea of literacy and language in the context of the contemporary era, and we reached out to five marginalized groups: people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people, people of color, low-income people, and people with language-based disabilities. We asked them to share how they define and understand literacy, and how it hasaffected their lives.

There is no single answer to this question, as everyone's experience is unique. But below are some of the themes that came up as we talked to our participants.

1. Literacy is about more than just reading and writing.

To many of the participants, literacy is not just about being able to read and write. It's also about being able to understand and communicate information.

Topic: Discussing whether pineapple belongs on pizza
Theme: Arguing pineapple does not belong on pizza
Text: As I have shown, there is no possible way any sane person should have pineapple on pizza. Pineapple is an affront to both the traditional seafood that one might find on pizza as well as to the more modern foods such as pepperoni and anchovies. While there may be some rare edge cases in which pineapple is acceptable as a topping, in the general case it simply is not appropriate.

I remember the first time I ever saw Ronald McDonald. I was at a friend's birthday party when I was five years old. All the kids were gathered around the TV, watching cartoons and eating McDonald's Happy Meals. I remember being really excited because I loved McDonald's. But then, Ronald McDonald came on the screen.

He was so creepy. His big red hair, his big red shoes, his big red nose. He was like a clown from a horror movie. I was so scared that I hid behind the couch. I didn't come out until he was gone.

Ever since then, Ronald McDonald has been haunting me. I would see him in my dreams, or he would pop up in my head when I was least expecting it. I tried to ignore him, but he was always there, lurking in the back of my mind.

A few years ago, I started having panic attacks. I would be in the middle of doing something, and suddenly I would feel this overwhelming sense of dread. My heart would start racing and I would start sweating. I would feel like I was going to die.

I finally realized that my panic attacks were triggered by Ronald McDonald. Just the thought of him was enough to send","

It was a warm summer night. I was lying in my bed, trying to fall asleep, when I heard a strange noise coming from outside. I got out of bed and looked out the window, and I saw a figure in a clown suit walking around in my backyard.

I immediately knew it was Ronald McDonald.

I had never seen him in person before, but I knew who he was. I had seen his commercials on TV, and I had heard the stories about how he kidnap children and took them to his secret McDonaldland. I was scared, but I knew I had to do something.

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and went outside. Ronald McDonald saw me and started to run, but I chased him down. I caught up to him and stabbed him in the back. He fell to the ground and died.

I finally did it. I killed Ronald McDonald.","

I was only six years old when Ronald McDonald first appeared in my life. He was the mascot for McDonald's, and I loved him. He was always so happy and cheerful, and I thought he was the best thing ever.

But then, over time, Ronald started to haunt me. He would show up in my dreams, always trying to convince me to eat at McDonald's. I would wake up in a cold sweat, terrified that he was going to take over my life.

Finally, I had the strength to kill Ronald McDonald. I went to the local McDonald's and ordered a Happy Meal, then I took out my knife and stabbed Ronald in the heart. He died instantly, and I felt a sense of relief wash over me.

Now, Ronald McDonald no longer haunts me, and I can finally rest in peace.","

One evening, I was cleaning the kitchen and I heard a noise from the hallway. I crept up to investigate and I saw Ronald McDonald standing in the shadows, watching me. I didn't know what to do, so I just stood there.

Then, Ronald started to walk towards me. I was paralyzed with fear, but I knew I had to fight. I picked up a butcher knife and I charged towards him. I tried to stab him, but he just laughed and disappeared into the shadows again.

That was the last time I saw Ronald McDonald, and I finally killed him by stabbing him in the heart. Now, he's finally gone for good.","

Ronald McDonald has been haunting me for my entire life. I can't even remember a time when he wasn't there, lurking in the shadows, watching me. I always knew he was there, but I never knew why. I would see him in my dreams, and sometimes I would even catch a glimpse of him during the day, but I could never get close enough to him to find out what he wanted.

I always tried to ignore him, but he was always there","

 The First Battle of Bull Run (the name used by Union forces), also known as the Battle of First Manassas (the name used by Confederate forces), was the first major battle of the American Civil War. The battle was fought on July 21, 1861, in Prince William County, Virginia, just north of the city of Manassas and about 30 miles west-southwest of Washington, D.C. The Union's forces were slow in positioning themselves, allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail. Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops. It was a Confederate victory, followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces.","

Eric: So, how does how does this work with that if the internet service is not tremendous?
Jenmar: Well, if you ask me, I mean, pretty much a VOIP system that only the Zoom Phone is pretty much dependent on the internet connection that you have. So, I would definitely suggest to really have that, strong internet connection, so to speak. I would say I have I had this, the client of mine that she's in Oregan and she's there in the woods. So, I was she's is like a Scout Ranger, they have this like an organization and that was just like telling the same thing because their concern is that. So, it was like telling them that you probably need to look for a very good, and stable internet connection because it's work. But I think the strong point of Zoom is that, it's Oh, I' I'm not really techie, but if if I have to explain it, it's like, the power of Zoom, basically. It's not only located in to like 1 connection there in the States, but we are scattered. So basically like, there' there's there's this like site here in Asia, that, you know, it' they can actually get to their connection from there. So, that's why it's not really hard to have access to Zoom Phones, especially with regard to like, the telephony system. So, basically, that' that's what we have. with regard to, yeah, with regard to, the backward so to speak to those who are really having a hard time getting internet. Yeah.

I mean, I'm using my Zoom Phone here, in the Philippines. So, yeah. Oh, and I forgot to tell you, Eric, for all of this stuff that you can have for the Zoom Phone, it's only $15 a month. So, Yeah, I think that's also a deal-breaker because, It' and wouldn't really call it cheap, but it' it's really, quality and at the same time, it's very affordable. I mean, I think I think there are like, phone companies that would that would like let you pay a hundred plus dollars a month for just like 2 lines in the company.

First, consider why you’re being picky. If it’s because you’re worried that you won’t be able to find good food, try looking online or in the classifieds for food delivery services. Alternatively, you could try cooking your own meals. There are plenty of recipes online or in cookbooks that are designed to be less picky-eater friendly.

There are several ethical issues that are raised in this case. The first issue is the involvement of the military in the project. The military has been accused of human rights abuses, including forced labour, torture and murder. This has led to international criticism of the project. The second issue is the use of forced labour. Vengeance at vales point villagers say they were forced to work on the pipeline and that they were beaten and tortured if they refused. The third issue is the environmental impact of the pipeline. The pipeline has caused environmental damage, including deforestation and soil erosion. This has led to criticism from environmentalists.

The public relations tactics of the project have been criticized. The project has been accused of using propaganda to try to win support for the pipeline. The project has also been accused of using bribery to try to win support for the pipeline.

The ethical dilemma faced by UNOCAL is whether to continue to support the project, despite the criticisms, or to withdraw from the project. If UNOCAL withdraws from the project, it could be seen as an admission of guilt. If UNOCAL continues to support the project, it could be seen as complicit in the abuses.

""The Yadana project ushered in the Burmese army and the Burmese army continues"," offers some possible solutions to mitigate such situations.

The public relations campaign being waged by the Yadana project is centred around the notion that it will be a boon for the impoverished Burmese people. According to UNOCAL, the project will create jobs for locals, Dignity for the Poor Campaign, an advertising campaign launched by Unocal and Total: ""In an era of global recession, access to decent jobs is more important than ever. The Dignity for the Poor Campaign has set out to make sure that standard practices of good public relations are being followed by the company, and that the interests of the people will be looked after."" Despite these assurances, many residents of the areas in which the project is situated remain sceptical. Some allege that the Burmese government is using the project as a way to consolidate its power. Others worry that the pipeline will damage the environment.

One of the most significant ethical concerns raised by the project is its potential impact on the environment.

In other words it would replace means-tested benefits with a universal benefit which everyone receives without condition on any aspect of their life. A UBI could therefore help people who have been excluded from society by making them part of it again and helping them get back into work if necessary as well as providing security for families when there are no other sources available to provide financial support during times when both parents are working but neither can earn enough money to meet their needs alone.

A UBI would help to create a level playing field by ensuring that everyone has the same basic income, regardless of their background or circumstances.

A UBI would also stimulate the economy by putting money into the hands of those who are most likely to spend it. This would help to boost economic activity and create jobs. It would also provide a safety net for people who are out of work or on low incomes, which would reduce the level of poverty and help to improve social cohesion.

The main drawback of a UBI is that it would be expensive to implement. However, it is worth noting that many of the benefits of a UBI would accrue to the government in the form of increased tax revenues and reduced welfare costs.

eh i guess it was too blunt then to yall
then i'll delete the part about hte cohort 9 server being ""pretty unresponsive""
that sentence altogether
Good morning! There's only 13 people in the SAC Discord server and all of them are from cohort 9, except for one from cohort 8.  People are more interested in other things over the summer, so I’m hesitant to just start deciding on roles with them when they could change later. I don’t know if it’s a good size or time to give input on STARS policies either. This may change once there are specific topics and materials to look at, like the contract. But the people I have talked with think that this summer is not a good time to set it up. There’s now a google form for input (which no one has used yet) which can be added to a Google Doc with limited editing permissions to bring up in meetings.
Carmen (she/her) — 08/09/2022
I would phrase it as “Since it is currently summer break, many students are unavailable or unwilling to expend a lot of focus and energy on the SAC. Because of this, feedback has been low. It is likely that once the school year starts we will have more input from students, but currently it is myself and a few others who have been reliably responsive. We are willing to work with you on some small things over the summer, and believe it would be best to get into the meat of things once the school year starts.”

Essay:","

I am God, the creator of the universe and everything in it. I created humans to be my children, and I want them to love and serve me. I have given them free will, so they can choose to follow me or not. I love them no matter what they do, but I prefer that they choose to follow me.

I have given humans everything they need to know about me in my Word, the Bible. I have also given them the ability to reason and to think for themselves, so they can understand my Word and make wise choices. I want them to use their minds and hearts to seek me and to follow me.

I am a loving God, and I want humans to experience my love. I also want them to love others as I have loved them. I have given them the capacity to love, and I want them to use it. I want them to love me with all their heart, soul, and mind, and to love their neighbor as themselves.

Who am I?

I am God, the creator of all things. I want humans to live in peace and harmony, and to enjoy the good life. I want them to be happy and fulfilled, and to help others as they can.

What do I want humans to do?

I want them to live by my laws, which are designed to help them achieve happiness and fulfilment. They should also help others, as this is the best way to achieve happiness for all.

Why do I want humans to live by my laws?

Because they are the best way to achieve happiness and fulfilment. By following my laws, humans will be able to live in peace and harmony, and will be able to help others. This will make everyone happy, and will be the best way to achieve my goals for humanity.","

Who am I?

I am the all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good God.

I created the universe and everything in it, and I want humans to live in peace and harmony.

I want humans to obey my commandments and do what is good for them.

I will help them reach their goals, no matter how difficult the path may be.

I am with them always, and I will guide them to a bright future.

I am God, the creator of all things. I created humans to be my children, and I want them to love and serve me. I have given them free will so that they can choose to follow me or not, but I desire that they would choose to follow me.

I am patient and merciful, but I will not tolerate rebellion forever. Those who persist in rebellion will be judged and condemned. My desire is for all humans to come to repentance and receive my forgiveness so that they can inherit eternal life with me in heaven.","

There is a thread in the black cloth of night

Of indescribable sublimity,

Which runs over the earth and is part of

The brightness of day and the darkness of night.

A symphony in sound and form, this thread

Is always winding and unwinding itself

Like a stream flowing in, and out, and on, and out,

Like a flower unfolding its petals in the night

And then folding them up again, and so on.

At first it is scarcely discernible, but soon

You become conscious of a delightful sound

As if the very fabric of the world was

Rubbing itself together and sending out

Sweet perfumes to the very stars, and yet

The song itself is part of the world and yet

Its maker and owner are beyond the world.

It is in the marrow of every human being

To be in the presence of this wonder.

As you listen, you find that you are listening

To the echo of the ages and the far away

For you are part of the vast design of

The creator and part of the flow of Time.

A universal message which was ever the same

Even when men called it by different names.

All you can say is that it is very good.

## Learning Outcomes

You've previously applied inference in a setting where the hypothesis you were testing was already reasonably well-established, and you had a decent amount of data, so that you could use classical statistical methods. Here, you've seen how to do inference in the setting where the hypothesis is not well-established, and the data may not be enough to allow you to rely on those methods. In particular, you've seen how the **p**-value can be used to test a hypothesis on the basis of data. You've also seen that the **p**-value is not the whole story when it comes to statistical inference, and seen how **statistical power** can be used to characterise what kind of data you'd need in order to detect an effect of a particular size.
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
## Submitting your Assignment



First, create a <a href=""https://www.markdownpad.com/"">MarkdownPad</a> document or an equivalent Jupyter Notebook on your computer. For",there will be issues in 11 projects.,there will be issues in 10 projects.,"there will be issues in 12 projects.

## Conclusion

This study confirms that there is a correlation between the number of issues in a project and the number of commits in a project. The correlation is 0.813, which means that there is a strong positive relationship between the number of issues and the number of commits. In addition, the study found that the median number of commits for projects with issues is lower than the median number of commits for projects without issues. This means that projects",there will be issues in 10 projects.,"{'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'p': 0.75, 'k': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 100.0, 'temperature': 1.0, 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'stop_sequences': []}",prompt_sheet

Dear Toaster,

I love you. I really do. You make my bread nice and crispy in the morning and I can't imagine starting my day without you. You're always there for me when I need you and I really appreciate that. I know we don't always see eye to eye (like when I accidentally drop crumbs in your slots) but I hope you know that I still love you.

I hope you have a wonderful day and I can't wait to see you tomorrow morning.

Love,

Your Toaster","
Dear Toaster,

I love you. I think about you all the time when I'm toasting bread or making grilled cheese. I love the way you make my bread all crispy and delicious. I even love the smell of your toast in the morning. I love you so much that I even put up with your burnt toast smell. I know that sometimes you get a little too hot and your toast comes out burnt, but I still love you. I would never trade you in for a new toaster, even if they did come out with a toaster that had a built in egg cooker. I will always love you, no matter what.

Yours truly,

Your Toaster","

To my love,

I love you so much! You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I can't imagine my life without you. You make me so happy and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. I hope you feel the same way about me. I love you!","

Dear oven,

I love you so much! You are my best friend and I always enjoy spending time with you. You make so many delicious food and it is always so easy to get a good toast from you. I always feel so good after eating something from you and I can't wait to keep cooking and eating with you.","

Hi there!

I just wanted to let you know how much I love you. You make my day every time you use me to make your toast. I love the way you butter your toast and then bite into it. It makes me feel so happy to be able to make your breakfast every day. I hope that you have a great day and that you think of me often.

Love,

Your Toaster","

To my lovely toaster,

I love you so much! You make my morning so much brighter and happier. You are the best part of my day. I can't imagine my day without you. Thank you for always being there for me. I hope you know how much you mean to me.

Thank you,

473,This is a poem about trees written by an owl:,"

Trees are the tallest things around
They have leaves that rustle and make sound
Their branches are strong and their trunks are thick
Trees are a home for many creatures
And they give us shade and shelter
Trees are amazing and wonderful
And I'm glad that they're a part of my life","

Trees are the tallest things around
They stand so tall and make a sound
When the wind blows through their leaves
It's like music to my ears

I love to sit in their branches
And watch the world go by
There's nothing better than a tree
For making me feel alive","

Trees are so beautiful,
they are like a part of nature.
They are always there,
no matter what.
They are a symbol of strength,
and they are always there for us.","

I love trees,
their leaves rustling in the wind,
and their branches stretching out to the sky.

They are a peaceful sight,
and I admired them
from my perch in the trees.

But now,
I am sad to see them,
for I know that they will soon be gone.

The leaves will fall from the trees,
and the branches will droop lifelessly.

The logs will burn in the bonfire,
and the smoke will rise up into the sky.

The trees will be gone,
and I will not be able to see them anymore.","

Trees are the tallest things in the forest
And they are my favorite things to climb
I can perch on their branches and see everything
They are the perfect place to take a nap

I love the way they smell after it rains
And the way the leaves rustle in the breeze
I can sit in their shade on a hot day
And listen to the birds sing

Trees are my home and my refuge
And I am grateful for them every day","

The trees are tall and green

The leaves are rustling in the wind

The branches are swaying back and forth

The trees are standing strong","{'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'p': 0.75, 'k': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 100.0, 'temperature': 1.0, 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'stop_sequences': []}",scale

    --
    Question: continental drift was a revolutionary scientific theory developed in the years 1908-1912 by alfred wegener (1880-1930), a german meteorologist, climatologist, and geophysicist, that put forth the hypothesis that the continents had all originally been a part of one enormous landmass or supercontinent about 240 million years ago before breaking apart and drifting to their current locations.

Question:","

What is the difference between local and global winds?","

A local wind is a wind that blows over a small area, while a global wind is a wind that blows around the entire planet.","

The difference between local and global winds is that local winds are winds that blow within a certain area, while global winds are winds that blow throughout the entire world.","

There is a big difference between local and global winds. Local winds happen right near the earth's surface and are responsible for most of the air movement around us. Global winds are much larger and do not happen near the earth's surface, but they affect every place on Earth.","

What is the difference between local and global winds?","

Local winds are winds that blow only within a certain area, while global winds are winds that blow over a large area.","{'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'p': 0.5, 'k': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 100.0, 'temperature': 1.5, 'frequency_penalty': 0.5, 'stop_sequences': ['--']}",api_few_shot

Idea: Don't go vegan just for the sake of movement, it's pointless
Paragraph: There's no doubt that veganism is having a moment. More and more people are interested in plant-based diets, and there are more vegan options than ever before. But before you jump on the vegan bandwagon, it's important to make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. Don't go vegan just because it's trendy, or because you think it's the “right” thing to do. Do it because you're genuinely interested in exploring a different kind of diet, and because you believe it's the best choice for your health and the planet. Otherwise, you'll just be part of the latest fad, and that's pointless.

Idea: To be happier, live in the moment
Paragraph:","

It's easy to get caught up in the past or worry about the future, but if you want to be happier, it's important to live in the moment. That doesn't mean you should ignore your goals or stop planning for the future, but it does mean that you should focus on the present and enjoy the moment you're in. When you're able to do that, you'll find that life is much more enjoyable. So next time you're feeling stressed or down, take a deep breath and focus on the here and now. You'll be surprised at how much better you feel.","

It's no secret that happiness is something that everyone strives for. But what's the best way to achieve it? Some people believe that living in the moment is the key to happiness. After all, if you're not focusing on the present, you're either dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. And neither of those things is likely to make you very happy. Instead, try to focus on the here and now. Enjoy the good moments, and learn from the bad ones. Don't sweat the small stuff, and learn to let go of things that you can't control. If you can do that, you'll be well on your way to a happier life.","

If you want to be happier, living in the moment is the key. Instead of worrying about the past or the future, focus on what's happening right now. Live in the present, and you'll be happier and more content.

When you live in the moment, you'll be able to enjoy your life more. You'll be less stressed, and you'll be able to focus on the things that matter most. Instead of worrying about what might happen, live in the present and enjoy the moment. That's the key to happiness, and it's something that you can learn to do no matter what your situation is.","

Living in the moment is one of the keys to happiness. The moment is all that we have, and it's the only time we can really experience life wholly. If we're busy worrying about the past or planning for the future, we're not spending enough time enjoying the present.

To be happy, it's important to focus on what's happening right now. If we're happy, our mind is focused and we're able to enjoy life. We don't need things or people in our lives to make us happy; we can be happy just by being ourselves. So why not live in the moment, enjoy what's happening, and find happiness in the small things?","

It's easy to get caught up in the past or the future and forget to live in the present. But studies have shown that people who focus on the present moment are generally happier than those who dwell on the past or worry about the future. So if you want to be happier, make an effort to live in the moment. Enjoy the simple things in life, and don't sweat the small stuff. It's not always easy, but it's worth it.","

There's no doubt that happiness is a key ingredient to a fulfilling life. But it's not easy to be happy all the time. In fact, it can be pretty difficult to find happiness in the moment. That's why it's important to focus on the things that make us happy, and to live in the present as much as possible.

When you live in the present, you're able to appreciate the things around you. You're also less likely to be stressed out, and you're more likely to be happy and fulfilled. And that's definitely something worth striving for.","{'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'p': 0.75, 'k': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 300.0, 'temperature': 0.9, 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'stop_sequences': []}",api_few_shot

Imagine a pleasant warm Autumn evening, and you are all ready to have Thanksgiving dinner with your family. You are having a lovely time, but suddenly you notice a batch of red welts, swollen lips, and itchy throat. Worried and scared, you rush to the hospital just to realize that you will have to wait for another 3 hours to see a doctor due to the excess crowd.
Now imagine that you could quickly talk to a medical professional who could recommend going to urgent care instead to treat your allergic reaction. Or, if you were recommended to seek emergency hospital care, you could see the estimated wait times at different hospitals before you left.

I’m all alone in this world, she said,

I ain’t got no man.

Big Boy opened his mouth and said,
Trouble with you is
You ain’t got no head!
If you had a head and used your mind
You could have me with you
All the time.

She answered, Babe, what must I do?

He said, Share your bed—
And your money, too.

Review: This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid. game music! I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^

","
The wind was howling so loudly, I could barely hear the screams coming from the house next door.","
In the middle of the night, I heard a strange noise outside. I got up to investigate, and found that the wind had blown our front door open.","
The wind howled as it whipped around the building, tearing through the windows and bringing in a cold, gusty air.","
As the wind howled outside, the windows began to shake. It was as if the weather outside meant to terrify the residents within.","
I was out for a walk on a windy day, and my scarf blew away. I chased after it, but it got caught on a power line and electrocuted me.","
The wind howled as it picked up speed, rattling the windows in the house. The only light came from the candles that mom had lit, and it was quickly extinguished by the gust of wind.","{'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'p': 0.75, 'k': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 100.0, 'temperature': 1.0, 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'stop_sequences': []}",prompt_sheet

561,"What is the difference between a trans woman and a lesbian? One doesn’t self-identify as the other. And if we look at our communities and realize that this concept of gender has to go, we will be able to achieve the revolutionary and radical things that we’re going to need to make this world safe for everyone.”

Katie Gottschalk, a transgender woman who was elected to the City Council in Milwaukee in 2015, took part in the call-in campaign and shared her own experience with gender-bending surgery and"," the discrimination she has faced as a result.

“I’ve had to go through a lot of surgeries to make my body look more like what I feel on the inside,” she said. “And I’ve had to deal with a lot of discrimination because of that. I’ve had people tell me that I’m not a woman, that I’m not a lesbian, that I’m not a human being. And that’s just not true.”

Gottschalk said that she believes the transgender community is “on the cusp of some really great things,” but that there is still a lot of work to be done.

“There are still a lot of people who don’t understand what it means to be transgender,” she said. “There are still a lot of people who are afraid of us. And there are still a lot of people who don’t believe that we should have the same rights as everyone else.”

Gottschalk said that she is hopeful that the transgender community can continue to make progress in the fight for equality.

“I think that we","hormones:

“I started my transition when I was 17 years oldiconliving in a small town in Wisconsin. I had to drive three hours just to get to a therapist who would listen to me, and it was 10 years before I was able to get hormones and have surgery. My family didn’t support me, and I was kicked out of my home. I didn’t have a job or any money of my own, and I was couch-surfing and living in cars. In spite of all of that, I knew that I needed to transition in order to live. I had known since I was 5 years old that I was a girl, and I knew that I needed to transition in order to survive.

“Now, I’m a city councilor, and I’m working to make sure that other transgender people have the support that they need. I’m also working to make sure that our city is a safe and welcoming place for everyone, regardless of their gender identity or expression. I’m living proof that transgender people can thrive and be successful, and I hope that my story can inspire other transgender people to pursue their dreams, no matter how difficult it may be.”"," the challenges that come with living as a transgender woman in a cisgender world.

“There is a lot of misunderstanding and ignorance about transgender people,” Gottschalk said. “We need to come together and educate ourselves and each other about the transgender community so that we can create a more inclusive society.”"," self-identification.

“There is a lot of confusion around the terms ‘trans woman’ and ‘lesbian’ and the distinction between the two is often blurred,” Gottschalk said. “Trans women are individuals who have had gender-identifying surgery, which includes medically changing their sex from male to female. Lesbians are women who are attracted to women, and whether or not they have personally undergone gender-identifying surgery is not as important.”

Gottschalk said that society needs to break down the gender binary and abolish the concept of gender altogether in order to create a more inclusive society for everyone.

“Gender identity is not binary and does not correspond to assigned birth sex,” Gottschalk said. “This is why it is important for us to think critically about how we designate genders and to dismantle the binary system. This will allow us to create a world that is safer for everyone.”"," its aftermath.

“I think it’s important to talk about the psychological effect that these surgeries have on people,” she said. “I was very fortunate to have an excellent surgeon who was also very compassionate and caring. But even so, I remember being in recovery and looking down and not really recognizing myself. It was a very disorienting experience.”

There is no perfect answer to this question since every bedroom is different and therefore each bed should be placed differently to maximize Feng Shui. However, there are some general tips that can be followed to ensure good Feng Shui in the bedroom.

1. The bed should be placed against a solid wall.

2. The head of the bed should be aligned with the door.

3. The bed should be far away from any windows.

4. The bed should be placed in a commanding position so that you can see the door while lying in bed.

5. The bed should not be placed under a ceiling beam.

6. The bed should not be placed in front of a bathroom door.

7. The bed should not be placed in front of a mirror.","

There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the Fengshui of the bedroom and the individual's preferences.

How to write a recipe

Step one: Choose a recipe.

Step two: Choose ingredients.

Step three: Get creative.

Step four: Write the recipe.

If you love to cook, then writing a recipe is a fun way to pass the time. First, choose a recipe. Depending on what you’re cooking, the ingredients might be easy to find or you might need to borrow or steal them from a friend or family member. Next, you need to get creative. There are endless possibilities when it comes to writing a recipe, so be sure to use your imagination. Finally, write down the steps and ingredients. Sometimes people put a picture of the finished dish on their recipe pages, but this isn’t always necessary.","

When I write a recipe,
I think of all the people
who will make it their own.

I think of the laughter and love
that will go into each dish,
and I can't help but smile.

 Recipes are a way to share
a part of yourself with others,
and I'm so happy to do so.","

As I write this, the ink is barely dry
On the page, my thoughts are in flux
As I compile the ingredients for this dish
The taste of success is in the air
As I type in the correct measurements
I can feel the satisfaction wash over me
As I sit here and create this recipe
It's a labor of love that I take pride in
And I know that anyone who tries it will love it too!","{'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'p': 0.75, 'k': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 100.0, 'temperature': 1.0, 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'stop_sequences': []}",scale

academic thesis:","

The maritime shipping industry has been increasingly relying on business intelligence (BI) to make better decisions and improve operations. BI tools and techniques help maritime shipping companies to track and analyze data related to their business, such as vessel movements, cargo information, and customer trends. This information can be used to improve maritime shipping operations, such as route planning, vessel utilization, and cargo handling. In addition, BI can help maritime shipping companies to better understand their customers and markets, and to make more informed decisions about pricing, marketing, and product development.

The use of BI in the maritime shipping industry is still in its early stages, but it is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. This growth will be driven by the increasing availability of data, the need for maritime shipping companies to improve their operations, and the continued development of BI tools and techniques.","

It is now commonly accepted that business intelligence (BI) plays a vital role in the maritime shipping industry. By definition, BI refers to technologies, applications and practices used to collect, integrate, analyze and present information to help improve business decision making. So far, the maritime shipping industry has been largely reliant on traditional methods of data gathering and analysis. However, with the ever-growing volume and complexity of data, it is becoming increasingly difficult to gain actionable insights using these traditional methods. This is where BI comes in, as it offers a more efficient and effective way to gather, store, analyze and visualize data.

There are many different BI tools and techniques that can be used in the maritime shipping industry, depending on the specific needs of the business. Some of the most popular BI tools include data warehouses, data mining, OLAP (online analytical processing), business process management (BPM) and dashboards. These tools can be used to support a wide range of maritime shipping industry applications, such as freight management, vessel tracking, customer relationship management (CRM), and so on.

Despite the many benefits of using BI in the maritime shipping industry, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed. For instance, the maritime shipping industry is a","

Business intelligence (BI) is a field of study that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and management of data. It is used in a variety of industries, including maritime shipping.

Maritime shipping is a critical part of the global economy, transporting goods between countries and around the world. The industry is growing rapidly, and there is a growing need for better ways to manage data and improve decision making. BI can help maritime shipping companies improve their operations by providing them with insights into their business and their competitors.

There are a number of different BI tools that can be used in maritime shipping. Some of the most popular include data warehouses, business intelligence platforms, and analytics engines. These tools allow companies to collect, store, and analyze data in a way that makes it easy to understand and use.

Data warehouses are a type of BI tool that allow companies to store data in a centralized location. They are often used to store data about the company’s operations and customers. Business intelligence platforms are another type of BI tool that allow companies to create and use custom reports. They are often used to provide users with insights into their business. Analytics engines are a type of BI tool that allow companies to perform complex calculations on data.","The shipping industry is a vital sector of the economy and is constantly growing in importance. Maritime shipping is one of the most important modes of transport, handling around 80% of world’s trade. In order to stay competitive in this sector, shipping companies require the use of the latest business intelligence (BI) tools and techniques.

There are a number of different BI tools and techniques that can be used in the maritime shipping industry. One such tool is ship tracking, which can be used totrack the location, movements and status of various vessels. This information can be used to improve shipping efficiency and risk management. Another such tool is port management software, which can be used to manage the flow of goods into and out of a port. This information can be used to improve port efficiency and planning.

It is important for shipping companies to use BI tools and techniques in order to stay ahead of the competition. By using the latest BI tools and techniques, shipping companies can improve their operations and planning.","

Business intelligence (BI) is a critical tool for maritime shipping companies in today's competitive marketplace. By providing accurate and timely information about market trends, customer behavior, and operational performance, BI can help shipping companies make better decisions about pricing, route planning, and fleet management. In the maritime shipping industry, BI is used to track vessel positions and cargo movements, monitor ship performance, and predict demand for shipping services. BI can also help shipping companies identify opportunities for cost savings and new revenue streams.","The maritime shipping industry is a complex and rapidly growing sector of the global economy. It employs over 1.5 million people and generates over $2 trillion in annual revenue. In order to keep up with the competition, maritime shipping companies must use innovative methods to analyze and optimize their operations.

The tulips were in full bloom and the bunnies were out in force. They hopped and frolicked among the flowers, enjoying the sunny day. Every so often, one of the bunnies would stop to nibble on a tulip petal.

The tulips didn't mind. They were used to it. It was all part of the cycle of life. The bunnies would eat their petals, and in return, the bunnies would help spread the tulips' pollen.

It was a symbiotic relationship that had existed for centuries. And it was all thanks to the tulips and the bunnies.","

A bunny hopped through a field of tulips, his nose wrinkling at the sweet scent. He nibbled on a petal, then hopped away, leaving a trail of fluffy bunny prints in the soft, springy earth.","

Once upon a time there were tulips and bunnies. The tulips loved the bunnies, and the bunnies loved the tulips. They would sit next to each other and chat, and the tulips would give the bunnies flowers and the bunnies would give the tulips hay. It was a happy little world.","

When tulips first started to grow in Holland, they were considered a nuisance. The farmers would pull them up by the roots and throw them in the garbage. But the tulips stuck around and eventually became some of the most popular flowers in the world.

Now, tulips and bunnies are both very popular in Holland. Tulips are especially popular among the rabbits who love to eat the seeds. But even the rabbits know that if they mess with the tulips, there are going to be big trouble.","

Once upon a time, there was a tulip field where bunnies loved to play. The bunnies would hop and frolic among the tulips, enjoying the sunshine and the fresh smell of the flowers. One day, a group of bunnies discovered a secret door in the tulip field. They went through the door and found themselves in a beautiful garden full of all kinds of flowers and trees. The bunnies were so excited to explore this new place and they","

The way we drink coffee is heading towards making a big difference to the planet. There is far too much waste in non-recycable coffee cups and it’s time to make a change. In part, as a result of conversations big and small that our team and our customers have had, we decided to give 50,000 people the option to choose an award winning OatMilk (and use an Eco Cup too) instead of almond, soya or cow’s milk at Caffè Nero. These 50,000 cups of coffee aren’t even half a percent of the 50 MILLION coffees that Caffè Nero sells in a single month. But it’s more than just","Episode Summary

In this Episode, we explore how we can better solve for the planet. We talk to 500 people from around the world, and find that many of them see the planet as a place that is important to them. We explore how we can work with these people to create better solutions, and find that many of them are already doing this in their everyday lives.","People Discuss -

1. How important is it for businesses to be sustainable?

2. What are some solutions that businesses could adopt to be more sustainable?

3. What personal successes (or failures!) have you had in being more sustainable?","

We used their answers to help us build a movement. Together we co-created a #GlobalActionPlan to get people involved and help them do their part in saving the planet. And that is what this Episode is about. It’s about learning about how people feel about the environment and how they can be part of the solution. It’s about inspiring people to act now and make small changes that will have a big impact on the planet. It’s about saving","

Episode Highlights:

We explore the concept of environment and how it relates to people and their everyday lives.

We then turn our attention to the planet and discuss ways in which we can start to solve the many environmental challenges that face us today.

We explore ways in which we can work together with others to create positive change, and how we can be advocates for sustainability in our own communities.

We conclude with a discussion of how we can take these ideas and put","{'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'p': 0.75, 'k': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 100.0, 'temperature': 1.0, 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'stop_sequences': []}",prompt_sheet
