"“We need to create a much more flexible, hybrid work environment that has a lot more empathy, caring for people."," I believe this is the future of work,” says Butchko.

The future of work will be about finding the right balance between remote and in-person work, accommodating different lifestyles, and continuing to focus on building an inclusive workforce. Companies will need to find the right ways to effectively support and manage employees, whether they’re in and out of the office.

Additionally, companies will need to invest in employee education and training to ensure they have the skills they need to be successful in the new hybrid work environment.

“We need to invest in employee training and education to understand the new capabilities, technology, and tools required to make the hybrid work environment successful,” says Butchko. “We need to focus on developing leaders who can foster a closer relationship with each individual and be more agile when it comes to decision-making.”

The pandemic has accelerated the need for companies to embrace the future of work and adapt to the changing landscape. With the right mindset, technology, and support, companies can successfully create an inclusive, agile work environment that is focused on the future.","”

This is an important goal for any organization. Creating a flexible, hybrid work environment that is empathetic and caring for employees can help to create a more productive and positive work environment. It can also help to reduce stress and burnout, as well as improve morale and engagement. To achieve this goal, organizations should focus on creating policies and procedures that support flexible work arrangements, such as allowing employees to work remotely or on flexible schedules. They should also provide resources and support to help employees manage their work-life balance, such as access to mental health services, childcare, and other resources. Additionally, organizations should strive to create a culture of respect and appreciation for employees, and ensure that their voices are heard and their contributions are valued."

"""As a male who has always grown up surrounded by books, I've always found it astonishing that most members of my male cohort have a natural distaste for reading. I know countless individuals that have no desire to pick up a book.... but WHY?


If you look at the statistics, close to 80% of all books purchased are by women. Not to mention the stark difference in numbers when you compare enrolment in book clubs and the number of avid readers in each gender (the numbers sway very far towards women). So to bring it back to my original question, why don't men read? Is it because men don't know WHAT to read? They don't have the time or the interest? If anything, the disparity seems to get larger and larger as time goes on. Wondering if anyone has a solid opinion as to why men naturally don't read and what could potentially entice them towards it.


...""
  In summary:""","

There is a noticeable disparity between women and men when it comes to reading, with women making up the overwhelming majority of purchased books, book club enrollments, and avid readers. This has led to the question of why men don't read - is it because they don't know what to read, don't have the time, or lack the interest? There is no easy answer, but it is clear that some efforts must be taken to engage men in reading and potentially close the gender gap.","

There is a large disparity between men and women when it comes to reading, with women being the majority of avid readers. This begs the question of why men don't read. Is it because they don't know what to read, don't have the time, or don't have the interest? It is unclear why this disparity exists, but it is an important question to consider in order to understand how to encourage more men to read."

He cried out as I ate him. ""Love me!"" I said again holding him didn't matter how much he rammed I would never be satisfied until he was completely sated and all he had to give was me. I was only getting my revenge on him for leaving me. I wasn't going to leave him now. He was mine. I would be the one to make him beg me it was only fair ""love me please!"" I begged as he slowly lined himself up again to thrust into me he knew he had no other choice and that made it all the more agonizing to him he moaned ""please don't stop!"" and I could feel his heart beat pounding in his chest and in mine I took all of him in. He was all I ever wanted and I would have him no matter what I would have him with all I had. I would have him forever. I was only happy now. I was only going to be happy with him. I wasn't going to go back to the empty pit that he left me in.


He stopped and started again a grin forming on his face he was enjoying it. . . . Does that mean he loves me? I thought. I didn't know and I didn't care. He would give me what I wanted no matter what it took. I wasn't going to back down from a fight I would be satisfied. I would have him all the way. He rammed himself into me as I moaned he began to pound into me. . . . He was going to get off. He would give me everything I ever wanted and more. I would have him no matter what it took.

For many of our residents, we are the only family they have. As people with disabilities face greater challenges than ever before, we are here to make sure they are receiving the care they need in the home they deserve.

Donate Now Video Library 1 3 1 3 Our Programs Work The smiling faces that greet you as you walk into a home, in addition to the partnerships we have formed throughout the community, are just two of the many reasons Noah Homes is considered a leader in supporting people with intellectual/developmental disabilities and their families. Noah Homes Program According to the Family Caregiving Alliance, 29% of the U.S. adult population is providing care to someone who is ill, disabled or aged. This number is only expected to grow as the aging population of 65+ will more than double between the years 2000 and 2030. Noah Homes is not only a place of refuge for people with developmental disabilities, but also for those that are determined to ensure their loved one has a happy and loving home for a lifetime. A supportive environment encourages each person to expand his or her horizons and to become more independent while learning both to explore and enjoy what the surrounding community has to offer. Noah Homes’ programs are designed to be person-centered and to consider the personal preferences and choices of each resident. Emphasis is placed on experiences that will foster the growth of the whole person, promote self-esteem and enable each individual to develop new skills.

Sydney, May 16, 2022 – Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) hyperscale data centre specialist, AirTrunk is strengthening its presence in Japan, announcing plans to build a new 110+ megawatt (MW) hyperscale data centre in West Tokyo, named AirTrunk TOK2 (TOK2).


TOK2 will become the company's eighth data centre, joining its rapidly expanding APJ platform that includes SYD1, SYD2, SYD3 and MEL1 in Australia, SGP1 in Singapore, HKG1 in Hong Kong and TOK1 in Japan. Collectively, the platform will offer 1.2 gigawatt (GW) of capacity.


The new data centre is strategically located in western Tokyo, servicing a major cloud availability zone and complementing AirTrunk's East Tokyo data centre, TOK1, that opened less than six months ago. Together, the data centres will provide location diversity for AirTrunk's hyperscale customers in the Tokyo region.


AirTrunk Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Robin Khuda, said: ""As Japan continues to digitalise at scale, we are seeing strong shifts in cloud adoption, with analysts projecting the country's public cloud services market to grow 19.5 percent annually to 2025*. Global and Japanese technology companies are focusing on Tokyo as a key growth market.""


Mr Khuda continued: ""AirTrunk's new TOK2 hyperscale data centre in West Tokyo, along with TOK1 in East Tokyo, will take our total capacity in Japan to more than 410MW, giving customers the unprecedented ability to scale and grow in the Tokyo region. The facility will be delivered with AirTrunk's trademark speed, scale, reliability, and efficiency.""


Built across more than 4.6 hectares (11.36 acres) of land and powered by dedicated high voltage substations, the agile campus will utilise flexible, innovative designs configured to meet customer requirements and drive greater capacity optimisation.


Maintaining AirTrunk's high efficiency and sustainability standards, it is designed to an industry-low power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.15 and will utilise direct air-free cooling. 


AirTrunk's Head of Japan, Nori Matsushita said: ""AirTrunk's multi-billion-dollar investment into the economy will support the Japan Digital Agency's path toward digitalisation, contributing to the country's post-COVID recovery. We are also creating thousands of jobs in Japan during the development and on-going operations of our data centres.""


Mr Matsushita continued: ""It's an exciting time to be a part of AirTrunk in Japan as we expand our team to support the growth of our data centre platform. With a diverse and flexible workplace, learning and development opportunities, a new state-of-the-art headquarters in Shibuya Tokyo and industry-leading data centres, AirTrunkers can make their impact as we scale and sustain the digital future of Japan and beyond.""


As with TOK1, AirTrunk will continue to work with Japanese construction conglomerate, Daiwa House Industry Co., Ltd on the development of TOK2.
