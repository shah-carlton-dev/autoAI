"""As a male who has always grown up surrounded by books, I've always found it astonishing that most members of my male cohort have a natural distaste for reading. I know countless individuals that have no desire to pick up a book.... but WHY?


If you look at the statistics, close to 80% of all books purchased are by women. Not to mention the stark difference in numbers when you compare enrolment in book clubs and the number of avid readers in each gender (the numbers sway very far towards women). So to bring it back to my original question, why don't men read? Is it because men don't know WHAT to read? They don't have the time or the interest? If anything, the disparity seems to get larger and larger as time goes on. Wondering if anyone has a solid opinion as to why men naturally don't read and what could potentially entice them towards it.

"""love me"" I mumbled as my mind went numb with pleasure he rammed his dick in me faster and faster I could feel it getting deeper and deeper until he exploded in me and my mouth came back down on his sweaty body and licked him all over as I drank in his essence.


He cried out as I ate him. ""Love me!"" I said again holding him didn't matter how much he rammed I would never be satisfied until he was completely sated and all he had to give was me. I was only getting my revenge on him for leaving me. I wasn't going to leave him now. He was mine. I would be the one to make him beg me it was only fair ""love me please!"" I begged as he slowly lined himself up again to thrust into me he knew he had no other choice and that made it all the more agonizing to him he moaned ""please don't stop!"" and I could feel his heart beat pounding in his chest and in mine I took all of him in. He was all I ever wanted and I would have him no matter what I would have him with all I had. I would have him forever. I was only happy now. I was only going to be happy with him. I wasn't going to go back to the empty pit that he left me in.


He stopped and started again a grin forming on his face he was enjoying it. . . . Does that mean he loves me? I thought. I didn't know and I didn't care. He would give me what I wanted no matter what it took. I wasn't going to back down from a fight I would be satisfied. I would have him all the way. He rammed himself into me as I moaned he began to pound into me. . . . He was going to get off. He would give me everything I ever wanted and more. I would have him no matter what it took.


""I love you"" I said again this time louder. I was almost there he muttered under his breath ""shut the hell up and take it bitch."" I couldn't believe it ""No!"" I moaned ""you're killing me I want to come."" He gave in and let me come.


When I came it was as if all of my emotions were laid out for everyone to see it felt wonderful I wanted more but that would be greedy he looked at me and kissed me all laong my neck ""I love you. ..."" I said faintly my body trembling"

In 1988 Stephen joined GE as the SE sales manager for GE’s Apparatus Service Division. In 1989 Stephen and his father Lloyd had an idea to start a rigid fabrication company focusing on offering world-class service and quality combined with low cost pricing. Thus Schoen Insulation was formed. For the past 20 years Stephen has lead Schoen Insulation to become the preeminent non-metallic machine shop in the U.S. with the simple mission of being the low cost supplier of non-metallic machined, cut and turned parts. His passions include serving his family, God, his business, Habitat for Humanity, and trying to play golf more than 3 times per year.

When International Paper took over Micarta, Bob became the Industrial Products Business Manager reporting to the Specialty Products Divison in Maryland. In 1997, Bob joined Schoen Insulation as Sales Manager to help with the growth of the company. Duties at Schoen have included overseeing Sales, Purchasing and Quality for several years. After Schoen expanded their facility several years ago he became more involved in the operations side of the business. Currently, Bob is the VP of Operations, minority owner and will do whatever is necessary to take care of our customers. Chris Hailand Sales Manager Chris graduated with a BS-Industrial Technology from State University College at Buffalo in 1982.

He left Spaulding in 1997 to join ART (Advanced Refractory Technology), a Buffalo, NY based company focused on the creation of non-oxide ceramics with principle applications in nuclear power, military and electronic applications. In 2001 Chris joined Schoen Insulation Services as a Technical Sales Manager covering the northeast U.S. and the Midwestern U.S. In 2008 he was promoted to National Sales Manager.

Target: Josh McGee, VP of Business Development at Blackhawk, a company that manages sales pipelines. Josh has been at Blackhawk for 7 years and helped scale the bizdev team to 20 people.
Objective: Compliment Josh on his work at Blackhawk, then ask if Blackhawk would be interested in partnering with Moda to integrate Moda's software into their product. Mention that Moda has helped Slack, Dropbox, and SurveyMonkey increase cold email conversion by 20%.
Message: Hi Josh,\nDuring some research of Blackhawk, I came across your profile - love how passionate you've been the past 7 years to help scale the Business Development team, while also being that go-to advisor for your growing customers.\nHowever, I imagine you still have customers requesting automated creation of outreach emails. I'm curious - are any customer accounts at risk that would benefit from AI-generated email templates? Slack, Dropbox, and SurveyMonkey all needed a way to do this. Since leveraging Moda, they have increased cold outreach conversion by 20%.\nDoes it make sense to explore ways we can help your team as well?\nBest,\nKatie

"---Article---
Sydney, May 16, 2022 – Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) hyperscale data centre specialist, AirTrunk is strengthening its presence in Japan, announcing plans to build a new 110+ megawatt (MW) hyperscale data centre in West Tokyo, named AirTrunk TOK2 (TOK2).


TOK2 will become the company's eighth data centre, joining its rapidly expanding APJ platform that includes SYD1, SYD2, SYD3 and MEL1 in Australia, SGP1 in Singapore, HKG1 in Hong Kong and TOK1 in Japan. Collectively, the platform will offer 1.2 gigawatt (GW) of capacity.


The new data centre is strategically located in western Tokyo, servicing a major cloud availability zone and complementing AirTrunk's East Tokyo data centre, TOK1, that opened less than six months ago. Together, the data centres will provide location diversity for AirTrunk's hyperscale customers in the Tokyo region.


AirTrunk Founder & Chief Executive Officer, Robin Khuda, said: ""As Japan continues to digitalise at scale, we are seeing strong shifts in cloud adoption, with analysts projecting the country's public cloud services market to grow 19.5 percent annually to 2025*. Global and Japanese technology companies are focusing on Tokyo as a key growth market.""


Mr Khuda continued: ""AirTrunk's new TOK2 hyperscale data centre in West Tokyo, along with TOK1 in East Tokyo, will take our total capacity in Japan to more than 410MW, giving customers the unprecedented ability to scale and grow in the Tokyo region. The facility will be delivered with AirTrunk's trademark speed, scale, reliability, and efficiency.""


Built across more than 4.6 hectares (11.36 acres) of land and powered by dedicated high voltage substations, the agile campus will utilise flexible, innovative designs configured to meet customer requirements and drive greater capacity optimisation.


Maintaining AirTrunk's high efficiency and sustainability standards, it is designed to an industry-low power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.15 and will utilise direct air-free cooling. 


AirTrunk's Head of Japan, Nori Matsushita said: ""AirTrunk's multi-billion-dollar investment into the economy will support the Japan Digital Agency's path toward digitalisation, contributing to the country's post-COVID recovery. We are also creating thousands of jobs in Japan during the development and on-going operations of our data centres.""


Mr Matsushita continued: ""It's an exciting time to be a part of AirTrunk in Japan as we expand our team to support the growth of our data centre platform. With a diverse and flexible workplace, learning and development opportunities, a new state-of-the-art headquarters in Shibuya Tokyo and industry-leading data centres, AirTrunkers can make their impact as we scale and sustain the digital future of Japan and beyond.""


As with TOK1, AirTrunk will continue to work with Japanese construction conglomerate, Daiwa House Industry Co., Ltd on the development of TOK2.
